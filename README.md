# design-intel

**The measurement, memory, and composability layer that LLMs don't have.** A CLI and MCP server for UX/UI design review that combines deterministic analysis (WCAG, axe-core, component scoring, fix generation, brand rules), multi-agent LLM critique, and an autonomous review loop driven by a real browser via Playwright.

Outperforms raw Claude Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 sessions on structured design critique benchmarks (94% ensemble vs 73-85% raw model) by combining deterministic measurement, multi-agent architecture, and multi-model ensemble synthesis.

Not trying to replace an LLM. Designed to sit *between* a website and an LLM, catching the things LLMs can't see — exact pixel measurements, alpha-composited contrast, cross-page patterns, regressions vs baseline — and handing the LLM grounded facts it can reason about.

## Performance vs raw Claude

*Last benchmarked: 2026-04-06. Model: Claude Opus 4.6, post-feedback iteration with token audit, hover media detection, and WCAG integration.*

### Benchmark scores against production sites

| Site | Score | Key findings | What standard Claude misses |
|---|---|---|---|
| HST Tracker (auth app) | 93.6/100 | Hover states gated behind `@media (hover: hover)` correctly detected; 11 spacing values on 73% grid | Can't measure grid adherence, detect media queries, count token usage |
| Linear.app | 79.8/100 | 15 text colours, 15 bg colours (palette sprawl); generic "More" button; unlabelled element | Can't count distinct computed colours or detect unlabelled elements |
| Notion.com | 75.9/100 | 408 tokens on `:root`; 12 hardcoded values flagged; 14 font sizes; WCAG 62.5% | Can't read 408 CSS custom properties or detect token-system bypasses |
| Stripe.com | 75.0/100 | 14 bg colours, 20 unlabelled links (`a.hds-link`), no hover states detected | Can't detect that 20 links lack programmatic labels |
| Hacker News | 79.2/100 | No H1, no headings, no landmarks, 30 links all under 24px, 13px body font | Can't measure that every link is 16px tall or that body text is 13.3px |

### What this agent does that standard Claude cannot

1. **Measures real CSS values.** Extracts computed styles from the DOM: exact font sizes, hex colours, spacing in pixels, border-radius, transitions. When it says "15 font sizes" it lists them with usage counts.
2. **Detects invisible issues.** `@media (hover: hover)` gated styles, missing ARIA labels, heading level gaps, unlabelled form inputs, absent landmarks. Invisible in a screenshot but measurable in the DOM.
3. **Scores reproducibly.** The deterministic layer produces the same score every time. 7-category scoring (typography, color, spacing, interactive, hierarchy, patterns, copy) is comparable across pages and over time.
4. **Crawls and aggregates.** Navigates an entire app via Playwright, reviews every page, and surfaces systemic issues (findings appearing on 50%+ of pages).
5. **Audits against existing tokens.** Reads the site's `:root` custom properties and flags hardcoded values that should use existing tokens.
6. **Compares against reference sites.** Extract a style guide from Linear or Stripe, then score your app against it.
7. **Composites alpha-blended backgrounds for true contrast.** Walks the DOM tree compositing semi-transparent layers to get the actually-rendered background colour, then computes the real ratio.
8. **Tracks regressions across runs.** Stores fingerprints per URL and gates CI specifically on NEW violations introduced by a PR. Grandfathers pre-existing issues.

### Honest limitations

- **Hover detection is incomplete.** Playwright's headless mode doesn't activate `@media (hover: hover)` rules. The agent now detects the media query and reports it correctly, but can't verify the actual hover styles fire.
- **Colour dominance metrics are approximate.** We count distinct colours, not visual area.
- **Component pattern heuristics are shallow.** "Form has 14 fields" is a useful flag but doesn't understand grouping or conditional fields.
- **The LLM opinion layer is only as good as the model.** It sometimes repeats what the deterministic layer already said. The `--no-llm` flag exists for a reason.
- **Genuinely novel UIs** (custom game UIs, VR, chart-heavy dashboards) confuse the component detectors.

---

## When to use this vs a raw LLM

### Where design-intel clearly wins

**Deterministic measurements.** Ask an LLM "what's the contrast on this?" and you get `~4.2:1` or whatever looks right. design-intel reads the DOM, alpha-composites overlays, and computes the exact ratio. Same for target sizes, spacing, type scale, palette counts. LLMs approximate; design-intel measures.

**Cross-page patterns.** Review a 13-page app with an LLM and you get 13 separate critiques. design-intel deduplicates findings across pages (*"`button.top-nav-tab` fails 1.4.3 across 7 pages, fix once"*).

**Regression tracking.** LLMs have no memory. design-intel stores per-URL fingerprints and gates CI specifically on NEW violations. The difference between "every PR yells about 20 contrast problems" and "this PR introduced one."

**axe-core for free.** 100+ industry-standard accessibility rules running in Playwright against the live DOM, not vibes-checked from a screenshot.

**Auto-fix patches.** LLMs say "darken the text colour." design-intel outputs `.button { color: #333; }` with the specific hex that achieves 4.5:1 on the actual background, verified by re-running the contrast calc.

### Where raw LLM clearly wins

**Quick gut check on a single screenshot.** Paste → 20 seconds → $0.02. design-intel needs Playwright, a browser, venv setup.

**Conversational iteration.** "What if we moved the CTA above the fold?" is natural in chat. design-intel's critique is one-shot batch.

**Truly novel UIs.** Custom game UIs, VR interfaces, chart-heavy dashboards: an LLM treats everything as a design surface; the component detectors don't.

## CI/CD integration

`design-intel ci --url X` is designed to drop into a GitHub Actions / GitLab CI / Bitbucket workflow without becoming noise. By default it runs in **pragmatic mode**:

- **Grandfathers pre-existing violations.** First run saves a baseline; the gate only fails on *new* regressions.
- **Severity-filtered.** Only axe-core `critical` + `serious` gate the build (tune with `--severity`). Moderate/minor surface in the report but don't fail CI.
- **Score-drop tolerance.** Allows ±2pp flicker on the WCAG score to absorb crawl/timing noise.
- **AAA ignored.** AAA criteria stay aspirational.

```bash
# Pragmatic (default)
design-intel ci --url https://preview.example.com

# Strict: gate on every A/AA violation and any score drop
design-intel ci --url https://preview.example.com --strict

# Hard score floor (works in both modes)
design-intel ci --url https://preview.example.com --min-score 70
```

Exit codes: `0` pass · `1` threshold failed · `2` technical error. Use `--format json` for machine-readable output.

**Drop-in CI templates:**

| Platform | Template |
|---|---|
| GitHub Actions | `templates/ci/github-actions-design-review.yml` |
| GitHub Actions (monitoring) | `templates/ci/github-actions-monitoring.yml` |
| GitLab CI | `templates/ci/gitlab-ci-design-review.yml` |
| Bitbucket Pipelines | `templates/ci/bitbucket-pipelines-design-review.yml` |

See `templates/ci/README.md` for setup instructions.

## Feature highlights

### Auto-fix generation

`design-intel fix --url X` turns deterministic WCAG failures into concrete CSS and HTML patches. No LLM; only emits fixes for issues with a mechanical correct answer. Binary-searches a corrected text colour that hits the required ratio on the actual background, verified after emission. Generates target-size rules, non-text contrast borders, missing landmarks, form labels, and `lang` attributes. Subjective failures land in `FixSet.skipped` with no speculative patches. Outputs `fixes-{ts}.css` + `fixes-{ts}.md`.

### Competitive benchmarking

`design-intel compare --url X --competitor Y` scores two sites side-by-side across 10 deterministic metrics: WCAG score, A/AA violation count, contrast pass rate, target-size pass rate, landmark coverage, heading hierarchy, design-token count, font-family discipline, palette size, axe critical+serious count. Report shows per-metric winners, "biggest gaps" where the competitor leads, and "where you lead." Lower-is-better is tracked per metric, so "fewer violations" correctly wins.

### Before / after diff

`design-intel diff --before X --after Y` quantifies what changed between two designs. Accepts URLs, local images, or a URL vs its stored history baseline. Produces score delta, three issue buckets (`new`, `fixed`, `persistent`), and a Pillow-based visual diff PNG with bounding boxes around changed regions. Exit codes match the CI gate so it's drop-in usable as a PR gate.

### Design system extractor

`design-intel extract-system --url X --output ./design-system/` reverse-engineers a complete design token system from a live site. Two strategies, auto-selected: **direct** (uses the site's own CSS custom properties) or **synthesised** (generates tokens from usage-counted raw values). Emits `tokens.css`, category-specific files, `tokens.json` (Figma Variables compatible), `tailwind.config.js`, and a README documenting source URL, date, strategy, and counts.

### User flow analysis

`design-intel flow --flow signup.yaml --base-url X` executes a multi-step Playwright journey, captures screenshots at each step, and benchmarks step count against industry norms (signup ≤ 3, login ≤ 2, checkout ≤ 5, onboarding ≤ 5). Structured YAML, not natural-language step parsing — flows live in version control alongside your code.

### Autopilot: LLM drives the browser

`design-intel autopilot --url X --goal "review the signup + dashboard flow"` launches a visible browser, screenshots each page, and asks Claude what to do next. Claude picks one action at a time (CLICK / FILL / NAVIGATE / SCROLL / DONE / STOP). Loop detection (identical action twice → graceful STOP), 3 consecutive failed actions → STOP, max-steps cap (default 20). Each action logged for audit. ~$0.30 in Anthropic credits for a 15-step journey. Output structure matches `interactive`: per-page reports + cross-page synthesis + `actions.md`.

### Scheduled monitoring

`design-intel monitor --url X` runs an audit, persists to history, diffs against the last baseline, emits a trend-aware report, and optionally posts to a Slack-compatible webhook on regression. **No embedded scheduler** — delegates timing to GitHub Actions, cron, etc. A weekly workflow template ships at `templates/ci/github-actions-monitoring.yml`. Webhook failures are recorded but never crash the job.

### Interactive review + pragmatic flags

**New to the project? Run `design-intel review`.** It asks four questions (target, mode, output format, optional context), shows the command it's about to run, confirms, then executes. Five modes: `pragmatic-audit` (no LLM, fastest), `pragmatic-critique` (top findings, severity ≥ 2), `deep-critique` (4 agents, no filtering), `brand-compliance` (rules.yaml), `everything` (deep + WCAG + components + interactions, no filtering).

---

## MCP server

`design-intel mcp` launches an MCP server over stdio, exposing six tools (`critique`, `wcag`, `components`, `handoff`, `fix`, `compare`) and the 39-entry knowledge library as resources. Any MCP-compatible client can call them as native tools.

**Configure in Claude Code / Cursor / Windsurf:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "design-intel": {
      "command": "design-intel",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Once wired, you can ask your coding agent to "run WCAG on localhost:3000" or "critique the staging deploy" from inside the editor. Knowledge entries are citeable as context via the `design-intel://knowledge/{category}/{slug}` URI template.

### What the deterministic layer catches

Pure analysis over DOM data, no LLM calls. The WCAG checker runs 11 checks across 10 criteria deterministically — same input, same output, every run. Alpha-composited contrast handles semi-transparent backgrounds. Off-screen elements (skip links) excluded from touch target checks. Multi-page violations deduplicated by unique element. AA and AAA target-size rows stay separated to prevent double-counting. The state-test harness falls back from `networkidle` to `domcontentloaded` on sites with persistent analytics so hover/focus tests run instead of silently timing out.

### What the LLM adds

Subjective judgement that code can't do: visual hierarchy and composition quality, typography rhythm, component intent vs semantics (is a checkbox being used where a toggle button would be correct?), ARIA pattern correctness against WAI-ARIA APG, screen-reader experience narrative, design-system maturity assessment, and root-cause analysis (which token maps to the failing contrast value?).

### Regression tracking

Every run is stored in `.design-intel/` with score, WCAG results, and issue inventory. Subsequent runs show a regression report with `Fixed`, `Persistent`, and `New` buckets and a signed score delta. Same fingerprinting powers the CI gate, the `diff` command, and the `monitor` trend report — one definition of "what counts as a regression" across all tools.

---

## WCAG coverage

The deterministic checker runs 11 reproducible checks across 10 WCAG 2.2 criteria. Plus axe-core for 100+ additional industry-standard rules.

| Criterion | Level | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| 1.3.1 Info and Relationships | A | Landmarks (`main`, `nav`, `header`, `footer`) + heading hierarchy |
| 1.4.1 Use of Color | A | Flagged for manual review |
| 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) | AA | Text/background pairs vs 4.5:1 (and 3:1 for large) |
| 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast | AA | UI component boundaries vs 3:1 |
| 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks | A | Skip link presence |
| 2.4.7 Focus Visible | AA | Stylesheet scan for `:focus-visible` rules |
| 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum) | AA | 24×24px minimum |
| 2.5.5 Target Size (Enhanced) | AAA | 44×44px (aspirational) |
| 3.1.1 Language of Page | A | `lang` attribute on `html` |
| 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value | A | Form inputs with programmatic labels |

The report separates A/AA failures (must fix for compliance) from AAA (aspirational). WCAG score is calculated on A/AA only.

Grounded in: WCAG 2.2 AA, Nielsen's 10 Heuristics + Severity Scale (0–4), Gestalt principles, Fitts's Law. Findings reference specific criteria by number and heuristic by name.

## Benchmarking

### Output quality vs raw Claude (excalidraw.com)

| Agent | Score | Specificity | Actionability | A11y | Design System | Unique |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **design-intel (ensemble)** | **94%** | 100% | 95% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| **design-intel (deep)** | **86%** | 100% | 50% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| Sonnet 4.6 (raw) | 85% | 100% | 50% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| design-intel (single) | 78% | 100% | 90% | 100% | 100% | 0% |
| Opus 4.6 (raw) | 73% | 75% | 50% | 100% | 50% | 100% |

Ensemble mode wins because each model's full output is preserved (no information loss) and the synthesis adds consensus analysis on top. Different models catch different things — the ensemble captures all of them.

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m tests.benchmark_critique
```

### Deterministic benchmarks (no LLM, reproducible)

The deterministic analysers ship with their own correctness benchmarks that fail CI if output regresses below 90%.

| Benchmark | What it scores | Floor | Current |
|---|---|---|---|
| `benchmark_fix_generator` | Coverage, contrast accuracy, target-size accuracy, HTML validity, determinism, selector quality | 90% | **100%** |
| `benchmark_competitive` | Metric count, winner correctness, symmetry, tie handling, lower-is-better discipline, markdown shape | 90% | **100%** |
| `benchmark_diff_analyzer` | Fingerprint-diff correctness, exit codes, score delta math, markdown completeness, visual diff, JSON shape | 90% | **100%** |
| `benchmark_monitoring` | Exit codes, fingerprint diff vs baseline, trend truncation, alert discipline, JSON shape | 90% | **100%** |
| `benchmark_system_extractor` | Strategy selection, direct fidelity, synthesis naming, dedup, file output, Tailwind+JSON shape | 90% | **100%** |
| `benchmark_brand_rules` | Rule loading, validation correctness, framework template parity | 90% | **100%** |
| `benchmark_flow_analyzer` | Step execution, screenshot capture, industry-norm benchmarking | 90% | **100%** |

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m tests.benchmark_fix_generator
```

### Testing

637 unit and integration tests across all modules, plus the deterministic benchmarks above.

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q \
  --ignore=tests/benchmark_critique.py \
  --ignore=tests/benchmark_fix_generator.py
