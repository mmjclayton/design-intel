"""
Friendly error translation.

Turns exception tracebacks into plain-English messages with concrete
next actions. Non-technical users shouldn't have to read a Python
stack trace to understand "your API key is missing" or "the site
blocked the browser."

Pure functions — caller decides how to render the output.
